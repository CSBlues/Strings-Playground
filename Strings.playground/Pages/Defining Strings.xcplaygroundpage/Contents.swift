/*:
## Defining Strings
In the previous playground, you declared number constants like this:
 */
let heightInCentimeters = 7817
//: To declare a string constant, you put text between quotation marks like this:
let favoriteBook = "The Sun Also Rises"

let traditionalGreeting = "Hello, world!"
/*:
The declared string values also appear in the results sidebar. ðŸ‘‰

 - Experiment: Practice by declaring `favoriteMovie` and `favoriteSong` string constants for your favorite movie and song:
 */
// Declare a favoriteMovie constant

// Declare a favoriteSong constant

let myNumber = 15
let stringInterpolation = "My number is: \(favoriteBook)"
let myString = "This is my string. \n \"This is a quote\"."

let strConcat = "string 1 " + "string 2" + favoriteBook

Next, take a string-based trip around the world.
